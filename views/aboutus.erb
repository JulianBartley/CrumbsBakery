    <p>Crumbs was founded with the goal of providing our customers with classic American baked goods in a warm, friendly atmosphere. By baking all our products on-site, we fill our stores with the delicious smells of fresh cakes and pies to bring back that delightful, warm feeling every time of the year. Each day, we bake everything from scratch using the finest ingredients.</p></center>
